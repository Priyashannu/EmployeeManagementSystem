## Employee Management System

## Overview

The *Employee Management System* is a simple Java application built using Hibernate ORM. It allows administrators to manage employee records efficiently by performing basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). This project demonstrates how Hibernate can be used to map Java objects to a relational database, making database interactions more straightforward and scalable.

## Features

- *Add Employee*: Add new employees to the system with details such as name, designation, department, date of joining, and salary.
- *View Employees*: List all employees, with options to sort and filter by attributes like department or name.
- *Update Employee*: Modify existing employee details.
- *Delete Employee*: Remove employees from the system.
- *Search*: Find employees by name or other attributes.

## Technologies Used

- *Java*: Core language for the application.
- *Hibernate*: ORM framework for database operations.
- *MySQL/PostgreSQL*: Relational database for storing employee records.
- *Maven/Gradle*: Dependency management and build automation.
- *Eclipse/IntelliJ IDEA*: Development environment.
